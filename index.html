        <p>Hello! Myself Mithilesh K S and I am currently pursuing my 1st-year undergraduate degree at Loyola ICAM College of Engineering and Technology, Chennai. I have a deep passion for technology, with particular interests in both cybersecurity and web development. These fields fascinate me because of their significant impact on the modern world, and I am driven by the desire to contribute to solving complex problems in both areas.</p>

        <p>Recently, I completed a 15-day Ethical Hacking course, which provided me with essential skills in penetration testing, network security, and vulnerability assessment. This experience has deepened my understanding of how to secure digital infrastructures and protect sensitive information. Alongside this, I completed a 7-hour course on Web Development Fundamentals through Infosys Springboard, where I learned the core principles of designing and developing websites. This certification has strengthened my web development skills, enabling me to create secure and user-friendly websites.</p>
        
        <p>In the future, I plan to dive deeper into cybersecurity, focusing on ethical hacking, while also advancing my web development knowledge. I believe that having expertise in both areas will allow me to bridge the gap between secure web design and robust cybersecurity practices.</p>
        
        <p>I am always eager to take on new learning experiences, whether through formal courses, hands-on projects, or collaborations. My long-term goal is to contribute to the tech industry by developing secure, efficient, and innovative solutions for real-world challenges, with a strong emphasis on protecting user data and maintaining digital security.</p>
